is just a hex value but,

0x<CC><V1><V2><Vn...>

for instance:
forward command is 0x01; there is one param, speed, max speed theoretically can only be 100 (100%), and a 2 digit hex value can hold max FF -> 255 -> 1 byte
so, the packet would look like this;

forward(30) => 0x01 0x1E 0x00 0x00 => 0x011E0000
                 |   |     |    |
command hex -----|   |     |----|
                     |     |
param value (30) ----|     |
                           |
null value because no param|

Packets will always be max 8 digits long for now

Packets can be optimal length, as parser will discard any bytes longer than expected length of packet after reading command
So, 0x011E0000 can be shortened to 0x011E
